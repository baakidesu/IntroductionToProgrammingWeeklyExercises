If you get this repo as a project instead of running them individually, you have to modify CMakeLists.txt like above:

Lets say you want to run Exercise2.cpp in Week06.
        
        add_executable(IntroductionToProgrammingWeeklyExercises
                      Week06/Exercise2.cpp
        )
Use this code block.
